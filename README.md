# push_swap
A number sorting algorithm with two stacks.

Rules:

sa : swap a - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements).

sb : swap b - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements).

ss : sa and sb at the same time.

pa : pusha- take the first element at the top ofband put it at the top ofa. Do nothing if b is empty.

pb : pushb- take the first element at the top ofaand put it at the top ofb. Do nothing if a is empty.

ra : rotate a - shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes the last one.

rb : rotate b - shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes the last one.

rr : ra and rb at the same time.

rra : reverse rotate a - shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The flast element becomes the first one.
